    <h1>D&#432;a M&#7855;m - Vietnamese Spicy Pickled Cucumber</h1>
    <img src = "./images/dua-mam.jpg" alt="Plate of Dua Mam">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my recipe on how to make Vietnamese pickled cucumbers! As weird as it is, this is one of my
        favorite vegetables dishes growing up. The pickled dish is savory, sweet, spicy, and so crunchy that it 
        is usually eaten with a carb for palette cleansing such as rice or porridge. It has a <strong>strong</strong> fish
        sauce emphasis. But would recommend trying it out regardless. This dish is usually not found in stores.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cucumbers (larger is better)</li>
        <li>100 ml Fish Sauce</li>
        <li>100 ml Water</li>
        <li>Few Thai Chili Peppers</li>
        <li>1 Garlic Wedge</li>
        <li>150 g Sugar</li>
        <li>80 mg of Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by slicing the cucumber in half the long way (hot dog bun slice).</li>
        <li>Scoop the seeds from the cucumbers out using a spoon.</li>
        <li>Slice the cucumber in diagonals to get thin .5 cm thick slices.</li>
        <li>Next dehydrate the cucumbers by placing them in a bowl and adding the 80g of salt. Toss the cucumbers around, 
            then let it sit for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 30 minutes of dehydration, wash the cucumber slices and squeeze them dry with paper towels to 
            remove all the excess water.</li>
        <li>Put the sugar into a pot and place on medium heat to start caramelizing until it becomes light brown. 
            Remove the pot from the heat and <em>carefully </em>add in the water and fish sauce.</li>
        <li>Bring the pot to a boil for 5 minutes. Then remove and let it cool down</li>
        <li>Slice the garlic and chili peppers (optional).</li>
        <li>Once the caramelize sauce has cooled, plac
            <ol>e it in a mason jar or any glass jar and add in 
            the cucumbers, garlic, and chili peppers. Stir the mixture gently, refrigerate and enjoy forever!</li>
    </ol>
